This seems to no longer be maintained upstream (for quite a long time), but is immensely useful. Even though I know almost nothing about ruby, I will try to ensure that it keeps running, at least until a good alternative springs up. Currently, I can verify that this works with ruby 2.2

To run it, you need the ruby interpeter and a few specific ruby gems such as Gettext and Gtk2.
